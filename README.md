# Portfolio site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The porfolio was created to showcase my projects from CodeClan. The app is live at https://jonnyhoudini.github.io/portfolio_2022/

## Getting started

In the project directory, you need to install the dependancies:

### `npm install`

Then run the app on localhost:3000:

### `npm start`
